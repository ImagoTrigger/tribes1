Revision notes for the core library example program.  


2/10/98, LH:  autoexec.cs addition for local preference setting, put in 
	.BMP files and a few .CS files that mission editor needs to run.  Now
	you can pop it and the terrain editor up.  What more can be done at 
	that point, don't know.  Also changed to FLYER.DTS shape.
